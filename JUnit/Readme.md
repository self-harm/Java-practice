<i><b>JUnit</b></i> — библиотека для модульного тестирования программного обеспечения на языке Java.

A JUnit test fixture is a Java object. With older versions of JUnit, fixtures had to inherit from junit.framework.TestCase, but the new tests using JUnit 4 should not do this.[5] Test methods must be annotated by the @Test annotation. If the situation requires it,[6] it is also possible to define a method to execute before (or after) each (or all) of the test methods with the @Before (or @After) and @BeforeClass (or @AfterClass) annotations.
